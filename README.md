Develop a program that uses 'ehrJMS.txt' as its input data. The program should parse information in file for any Protected Health Information (PHI) items listed in 'phi1.txt'. Upon finding a match, the program should replace the PHI item with the corresponding tag as specified in the tagging instructions below:

Name------------------------------> *name*
Address -------------------------->*address*
Date of birth--------------------->*dob*
Social Security number------->*ssn*
Phone number------------------>*phone*
